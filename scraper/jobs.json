All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.**  \n\n\nUNDP is the knowledge frontier organization for sustainable development in the UN Development System and serves as the integrator for collective action to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNDP\u2019s policy work carried out at HQ, Regional and Country Office levels offers a spectrum of deep local knowledge to cutting-edge global perspectives and advocacy. In this context, UNDP invests in its Global Policy Network (GPN), a network of field-based and global technical expertise across a wide range of knowledge domains and in support of the signature solutions and organizational capabilities envisioned in UNDP\u2019s Strategic Plan.\n\n\n\nWithin the GPN, the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) has the responsibility for developing all relevant policies and guidances responsible for UNDP\u2019s Strategic Plan. BPPS staff provide technical advice to Country Offices, advocate for UNDP corporate messages, represent UNDP at multi-stakeholder dialogues including public-private, government and civil society dialogues, and engage in UN inter-agency coordination in specific thematic areas.\n\n\n\nUNDP's 2022-2025 Strategic Plan highlights our continued commitment to eradicating poverty, accompanying countries in their pathways towards the SDGs and working towards the Paris Agreement. As part of the Global Policy Network in the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, UNDP's Nature Hub and Climate Hub promote and scale up integrated whole-of-governance approaches and nature-based solutions that reduce poverty and inequalities, strengthen livelihoods and inclusive growth, mitigate conflict, forced migration and displacement, and promote more resilient governance systems that advance linked peace and security agendas.\n\n\n\nBPPS work with governments, civil society, and private sector partners to integrate nature, climate, energy and waste related concerns into national and sector planning and inclusive growth policies, support country obligations under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, and oversee the implementation of the UN\u2019s largest portfolio of in-country programming nature, climate change, energy, and waste and chemicals. This multi-billion-dollar portfolio encompasses:\n\n\n* Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services including forests;\n* Sustainable Land Management and Desertification including food and commodity systems;\n* Water and Ocean Governance including SIDS;\n* Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation;\n* Sustainable Energy;\n* Extractive Industries;\n* Chemicals and Waste Management;\n* Environmental Governance and Green\/Circular Economy; and SCP approaches.\n\n\nThis work advances crosscutting themes on innovative finance, capacity development, human rights, gender equality, health, technology, and South-South learning and digital transformation.\n\n\n\nUNDP launched its first Digital Strategy in mid-2019 to harness digital transformation within the organization. Building on a long history of project-level digital support for partners, the strategy represented a systematic and corporate-driven transformation process to reimagine the way UNDP serves its partners and operates its systems and processes. UNDP continues to accelerate these efforts in response to growing demand from partner governments and to support our development partners to ensure that the arc of future digital transformation protects human rights and leaves no one behind.\n\n\n\nIn line with the Digital Strategy 2019-2021, Digital Strategy 2022-2025 maintains and accelerates the momentum that has already been generated across UNDP and among its partners. Many of the components are already in place such as the Accelerator Labs, the Digital Advocates Network, a comprehensive IT transformation, and the Chief Digital Office (CDO).\n\n\n\nBeing a part of the BPPS the Nature Hub and Climate Hub embarked on a road to accelerate digital transformation in collaboration with the CDO in the Executive Office, bringing digital technologies and data into different levels of decision-making processes and programming within the portfolio. The Nature Hub is working with multiple partners and stakeholders to advance the digital transformation for green transition. A new global project \u2018Digital Transformation for Green Transition\u2019 which aims to provide global support to the GEF\/GCF portfolio, while leveraging the strong portfolio to enable other financing opportunities. The project objective is to enable scaled digital support to countries\u2019 green transition, through Digital Public Goods \/ Infrastructure for transparency and green finance; data capacity building; and Digital Readiness assessment and demonstrations. One of the project objectives is also to highlight the importance of digital as one of the key enablers, build upon the digital strategic Plan, and put forth a vision whereby digital is an empowering force for people and planet.\n\n\n\nUNDP\u2019s Digital Public Goods for Development (DPG4D) global project funded by the Government of Norway\/Norad aims to improve the availability and discoverability of Digital Public Goods (DPGs) for development. DPGs are open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm by design and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As part of this effort, the Chief Digital Office (CDO) works with the Nature Hub to implement effective, inclusive, rights-based DPGs. The project is anchored within the upcoming global project \/ preparation.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are several ongoing DPGs being scoped, developed, and implemented within various national context to enhance transparency and access to environmental finance:\n\n\n**Climate Transparency DPG:** underscores the necessity of embracing digital systems that encompass Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) mechanisms alongside national carbon registries and the Greenhouse Inventory system. These digital infrastructures are indispensable for nations seeking access to climate finance. They serve as pivotal technological components, empowering countries to bolster the transparency and reliability of their reports on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as mandated by the Paris Agreement. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in facilitating efficient carbon credit trading, thereby enabling countries to secure financial support for both climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.\n\n\n**Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) DPG:** PES is an innovative cash transfer mechanism that can directly provide benefit sharing of climate finance to farmers and local communities, which UNDP has a long-standing experience in supporting governments for policy and implementation. Leveraging on emerging technologies, of which many are open source, UNDP is designing the base architecture and convening partnerships with existing providers, to create a coherent, working PES system for countries newly embarking on a PES mechanism.\n\n\n\nIn addition, a Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA) tool is being developed to support the DPG deployment and to find entry points to opportunities. The DRA is a survey-based system that provides quick, high-level insights into a country's digital capabilities and opportunities. This may be applied to countries in parallel to embarking on digital system development and will need to be closely coordinated.\n\n\n\nWithin this overall background, reporting to the Lead, Digital Innovation for Nature Climate and Energy, the DPG Product Management Specialist will be responsible for 1) Ensuring operation and maintenance of the DPG global codebase as well as act as a product manager for the development of additional modules and new features, in close collaboration with technical experts and advisors. 2) Providing technical support and assistance to installing and customizing DPG systems in various countries.\n\n\n\nThe DPG Product Management Specialist is expected to work collaboratively with cross-functional DPG teams, Partners and stakeholders to enhance DPG services and play a significant role in advancing the organization's overarching objectives.\n\n  \n\n\n**Duties and Responsibilities**  \n\n\nThe Digital Public Good Product Management Specialist will oversee the product design and development process of the Climate Transparency DPG, and any related DPG products that are identified across the Nature and Climate Hubs.
