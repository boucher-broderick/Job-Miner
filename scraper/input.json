Exercises no direct supervision over staff. **CLASS CHARACTERISTICS** *Engineering Technician I:* This is the entry-level class in the paraprofessional Engineering Technician series. Initially under close supervision, incumbents with basic technical engineering experience perform work such as maintaining engineering records, performing basic engineering calculations, performing field observations and surveys, researching engineering topics, and updating maps and drawings, in addition to performing office and field work related to assigned engineering projects and programs. As experience is gained, assignments become more varied and are performed with greater independence. Positions at this level usually perform most of the duties required of the II level but are not expected to function at the same skill level and usually exercise less independent discretion and judgment in matters related to work procedures and methods. Work is usually supervised while in progress and fits an established structure or pattern. Exceptions or changes in procedures are explained in detail as they arise. Since this class is often used as a training class, employees may have only limited or no directly related work experience. *Engineering Technician* *II**:* This is the full journey-level class in the paraprofessional Engineering Technician series. Incumbents perform the full range of technical work in field observations and surveys, researching engineering topics, and updating maps and drawings, in addition to performing plan checks and office and field work related to assigned engineering projects and programs. Positions at this level are distinguished from the I level by the performance of the full range of duties as assigned, working independently, and exercising judgment and initiative. Positions at this level receive only occasional instruction or assistance as new or unusual situations arise and are fully aware of the operating procedures and policies of the work unit. This class is distinguished from the professional engineering series in that the latter is a professional level requiring completion of a four-year degree.  Positions in the Engineering Technician class series are flexibly staffed and positions at the II-level are normally filled by advancement from the I-level after gaining the knowledge, skill, and experience which meet the qualifications for and after demonstrating the ability to perform the work of the higher-level class.  **Essential and Marginal Duties**---------------------------------**EXAMPLES OF TYPICAL JOB FUNCTIONS (Illustrative Only)***Management reserves the right to add, modify, change, or rescind the work assignments of different positions and to make reasonable accommodations so that qualified employees can perform the essential functions of the job.*  * Prepares or assists in the preparation of and\/or interprets specifications, plans, permits, estimates, and reports pertaining to the construction, maintenance, and operation of a variety of engineering, land development, utility, and other Capital Improvement Program (CIP) projects.* Maintains engineering and traffic\/transportation files, including plans, studies, inspections, surveys, maps, and other data related to engineering and transportation projects;

All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.**  UNDP is the knowledge frontier organization for sustainable development in the UN Development System and serves as the integrator for collective action to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNDPs policy work carried out at HQ, Regional and Country Office levels offers a spectrum of deep local knowledge to cutting-edge global perspectives and advocacy. In this context, UNDP invests in its Global Policy Network (GPN), a network of field-based and global technical expertise across a wide range of knowledge domains and in support of the signature solutions and organizational capabilities envisioned in UNDPs Strategic Plan.Within the GPN, the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) has the responsibility for developing all relevant policies and guidances responsible for UNDPs Strategic Plan. BPPS staff provide technical advice to Country Offices, advocate for UNDP corporate messages, represent UNDP at multi-stakeholder dialogues including public-private, government and civil society dialogues, and engage in UN inter-agency coordination in specific thematic areas.UNDP's 2022-2025 Strategic Plan highlights our continued commitment to eradicating poverty, accompanying countries in their pathways towards the SDGs and working towards the Paris Agreement. As part of the Global Policy Network in the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, UNDP's Nature Hub and Climate Hub promote and scale up integrated whole-of-governance approaches and nature-based solutions that reduce poverty and inequalities, strengthen livelihoods and inclusive growth, mitigate conflict, forced migration and displacement, and promote more resilient governance systems that advance linked peace and security agendas.BPPS work with governments, civil society, and private sector partners to integrate nature, climate, energy and waste related concerns into national and sector planning and inclusive growth policies, support country obligations under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, and oversee the implementation of the UNs largest portfolio of in-country programming nature, climate change, energy, and waste and chemicals. This multi-billion-dollar portfolio encompasses:* Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services including forests;* Sustainable Land Management and Desertification including food and commodity systems;* Water and Ocean Governance including SIDS;* Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation;* Sustainable Energy;* Extractive Industries;* Chemicals and Waste Management;* Environmental Governance and Green\/Circular Economy; and SCP approaches.This work advances crosscutting themes on innovative finance, capacity development, human rights, gender equality, health, technology, and South-South learning and digital transformation.UNDP launched its first Digital Strategy in mid-2019 to harness digital transformation within the organization. Building on a long history of project-level digital support for partners, the strategy represented a systematic and corporate-driven transformation process to reimagine the way UNDP serves its partners and operates its systems and processes. UNDP continues to accelerate these efforts in response to growing demand from partner governments and to support our development partners to ensure that the arc of future digital transformation protects human rights and leaves no one behind.In line with the Digital Strategy 2019-2021, Digital Strategy 2022-2025 maintains and accelerates the momentum that has already been generated across UNDP and among its partners. Many of the components are already in place such as the Accelerator Labs, the Digital Advocates Network, a comprehensive IT transformation, and the Chief Digital Office (CDO).Being a part of the BPPS the Nature Hub and Climate Hub embarked on a road to accelerate digital transformation in collaboration with the CDO in the Executive Office, bringing digital technologies and data into different levels of decision-making processes and programming within the portfolio. The Nature Hub is working with multiple partners and stakeholders to advance the digital transformation for green transition. A new global project \u2018Digital Transformation for Green Transition which aims to provide global support to the GEF\/GCF portfolio, while leveraging the strong portfolio to enable other financing opportunities. The project objective is to enable scaled digital support to countries green transition, through Digital Public Goods \/ Infrastructure for transparency and green finance; data capacity building; and Digital Readiness assessment and demonstrations. One of the project objectives is also to highlight the importance of digital as one of the key enablers, build upon the digital strategic Plan, and put forth a vision whereby digital is an empowering force for people and planet.UNDPs Digital Public Goods for Development (DPG4D) global project funded by the Government of Norway\/Norad aims to improve the availability and discoverability of Digital Public Goods (DPGs) for development. DPGs are open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm by design and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As part of this effort, the Chief Digital Office (CDO) works with the Nature Hub to implement effective, inclusive, rights-based DPGs. The project is anchored within the upcoming global project \/ preparation.At this time, there are several ongoing DPGs being scoped, developed, and implemented within various national context to enhance transparency and access to environmental finance:**Climate Transparency DPG:** underscores the necessity of embracing digital systems that encompass Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) mechanisms alongside national carbon registries and the Greenhouse Inventory system. These digital infrastructures are indispensable for nations seeking access to climate finance. They serve as pivotal technological components, empowering countries to bolster the transparency and reliability of their reports on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as mandated by the Paris Agreement. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in facilitating efficient carbon credit trading, thereby enabling countries to secure financial support for both climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.**Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) DPG:** PES is an innovative cash transfer mechanism that can directly provide benefit sharing of climate finance to farmers and local communities, which UNDP has a long-standing experience in supporting governments for policy and implementation. Leveraging on emerging technologies, of which many are open source, UNDP is designing the base architecture and convening partnerships with existing providers, to create a coherent, working PES system for countries newly embarking on a PES mechanism.In addition, a Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA) tool is being developed to support the DPG deployment and to find entry points to opportunities. The DRA is a survey-based system that provides quick, high-level insights into a country's digital capabilities and opportunities. This may be applied to countries in parallel to embarking on digital system development and will need to be closely coordinated.Within this overall background, reporting to the Lead, Digital Innovation for Nature Climate and Energy, the DPG Product Management Specialist will be responsible for 1) Ensuring operation and maintenance of the DPG global codebase as well as act as a product manager for the development of additional modules and new features, in close collaboration with technical experts and advisors. 2) Providing technical support and assistance to installing and customizing DPG systems in various countries.The DPG Product Management Specialist is expected to work collaboratively with cross-functional DPG teams, Partners and stakeholders to enhance DPG services and play a significant role in advancing the organization's overarching objectives.  **Duties and Responsibilities**  The Digital Public Good Product Management Specialist will oversee the product design and development process of the Climate Transparency DPG, and any related DPG products that are identified across the Nature and Climate Hubs.

D4Hs Stanford Cancer Supportive Care Program achieved a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 91 from 90+ patients; most reported significant improvement in anxiety, depression, pain, and energy levels.Guided by **The NIMHD Research Framework**, this research will study the effects of intersectional identities on racial\/ethnic equity, reduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) bias, and develop a culturally sensitive novel habit-building algorithm for minority Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients using Creative Arts Therapy (CAT: Music, Dance, Arts) for remote activity engagement systems with multilevel data tracking and effective behavior prompts. We will partner with **Stanford, Institute on Aging, Koelsch Communities, Generation United, and Heritage On The Marina** to develop a groundbreaking smart platform integrating biosensors and a Telehealth Live Video Platform (TLVP). This project aims to gather insights into different **domains (Biological, Behavioral, Physical\/Built Environment, Sociocultural Environment, Healthcare System) and levels (Individual, Interpersonal, Community, Societal)** that influence healthy habits, then analyze the data to adapt D4H to improve patients mobility and social connections. D4Hs proprietary personalization will tailor to users needs\/desires and pair them with compatible buddies to build lasting habits with recorded and live video classes (think YouTube + Zoom + eHarmony for health buddies).You will work with a multidisciplinary team of experts in health disparity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, biotracking, behavioral sciences, dance therapy, and data\/AI science. **Research experience is a bonus but not required.****WebRTC Software Engineer Role:*** Build a user-friendly interface tailored to varied preferences, mobility, and accessibility needs.* Determine how tracking and adaptive video technology can be used to develop a personalized habit-building platform, integrating cultural awareness.* Design changes or additions to the current telehealth platform, particularly in incorporating body tracking or additional musical feedback elements.* Select platforms, plan features and define the architecture and technology road map.* Adopt an appropriate development methodology. Estimate costs and timelines.* Integrate bio-sensors to telehealth platforms (ReactJS, WebRTC, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).**Why this study:** 34.2 M Americans with DM cost $327 B in 2018. 68% of them will die from cardiovascular disease. CDC reported that DM disproportionately affects minorities. Partnering with Stanford professors Dr. Palaniappan and Dr. Haddad, who have pioneered research on health disparities and exercise\/dance intervention for DM patients, this innovation will expand the research field and have a broader impact on minority health. Currently, there is a lack of data on effective lifestyle recommendations for normal-weight diabetics (NWD), accounting for 1 in 5 Type II DM patients. NWD is especially prevalent in Asian populations and the elderly, facing higher mortality rates than obese diabetics. Research shows dance improves DM and reduces cardiovascular deaths by 46%. These interventions, however, are only available in person. There are many exercise programs and live video tools, but they rarely cater to an individuals mobility and accessibility needs. Hence, there is an unmet need for an easy-to-adopt telehealth platform enticing patients to dance from home.**AI Bias:** Integrating AI into clinical practice requires addressing biases. Three types of bias can be identified in healthcare: data-driven, algorithmic, and human. AI algorithms that propagate deeply-rooted societal bias can have catastrophic impacts. Consequently, some patient groups, such as ethnic and gender minorities underrepresented in existing datasets, can be misdiagnosed, further amplifying inequalities. Every step of the algorithm development process can be influenced by bias. It begins when designing the study and collecting data, continues with data entry, cleaning, and algorithm design, and ends with implementing the models and disseminating the results.**Impact and Next Step:** This study will establish clear metrics of health equity success; outcomes will be publicized (papers\/conferences) to incentivize action and influence policymakers. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter trial with American Heart Association to integrate more biosensors, voice user interfaces, and culture-sensitive AI to further increase adoption and engagement and reduce health disparities.Job Type: ContractPay: Up to $149,847.93 per yearBenefits:* Flexible scheduleExperience:* React: 3 years (Required)* JavaScript: 5 years (Required)Work Location: Remote"}
